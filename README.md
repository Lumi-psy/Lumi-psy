Aspiring dedicated researcher with a profound passion for understanding how the brain works to understand the neurobiological bases of behavior, thought, and emotion. I delve into the intricacies of individual and social dynamics, exploring the depths of emotions, engagement, mental health, and wellbeing. With a keen understanding of the profound impact these factors have on human lives, I am motivated to drive meaningful change.

Recognizing the importance of embracing neurodiversity, I am interested in creating inclusive spaces within organizations. By advocating for the integration of individuals with diverse cognitive abilities, I would like to cultivate a workforce that thrives on the unique strengths and perspectives that each individual brings.

When I'm not working or diving into research articles, you can find me catching up with anime and Turkish dramas, enjoying the latest movies at the theatre, playing video games, and hunting for delicious foods. I also love outdoor activities and sports, be it watching or playing.
